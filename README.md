## Exposed surface area estimator for cargo tanks / highway tanks.

The program uses data (capacity, tank specification, and exposed surface) from actual tanks. The data was collected from different tank manufacturers situated across Canada and the USA.

The estimator isn't perfect, but it should give you ballpark estimates. 

You'll need a couple of additional python libraries installed:
- matplotlib
- scipy

If you have any suggestions, then please feel free to get in touch with me.
